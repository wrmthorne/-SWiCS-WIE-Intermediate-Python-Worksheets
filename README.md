# SWiCS & WIE Advanced Python Worksheets

These worksheets were made for the middle two sessions in a series of 6, led by Sheffield Women in Computer Science and Women in Engineering at the University of Sheffield.

These sessions introduce package imports and the use of common data analysis packages for python. The first session focusses on NumPy, why it is useful, how it differs from Python and how to use it. The second session makes use of Pandas for structured data analysis.

The other worksheets can be found in their respective repositories:
